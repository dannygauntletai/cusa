# Backend Structure Document for Educhain Offline Quiz App

## Introduction

The backend of the Educhain Offline Quiz App plays a pivotal role in powering the entire quiz generation and evaluation process. Acting as the working engine behind the scenes, it manages interactions between user inputs, the local AI model for generating questions, and the overall data flow within the application. This document explains how the backend is organized and how it supports the need for an offline-first, reliable, and user-friendly quiz experience on macOS.

## Backend Architecture

The backend is built using Python with a FastAPI framework, which provides a modern, efficient, and easy-to-read API structure. This layered design separates concerns by isolating the logic that communicates with the local GenAI engine from the API endpoints that interact with the frontend. The architecture supports scalability and future flexibility by allowing new endpoints or integrations to be added with minimal disruption. Robust error handling is a key feature, ensuring that any issues during quiz generation or connectivity problems are neatly caught and managed without affecting the user experience.

## Database Management

For the initial setup, the backend utilizes SQLite as its database solution. SQLite is ideal in this scenario because it is lightweight, easy to configure, and works perfectly in a local environment. Data such as temporary quiz configurations or future expansions like quiz history can be managed with SQLite. The current focus is on generating and managing quiz data on the fly; however, the structure is designed to support structured data storage and retrieval practices that can be extended to more complex data management in subsequent releases.

## API Design and Endpoints

The APIs are designed using RESTful principles to ensure smooth communication between the frontend and backend. FastAPI handles the creation of endpoints that accept user inputs such as quiz topics and question types. Key endpoints cover requests for generating multiple choice or true/false questions, as well as managing settings such as changing the AI model from the default mistral to alternatives. The APIs are built to provide immediate responses or error notifications so that if the local generation engine fails or if a connectivity issue occurs with the optional web search, the system can quickly revert to a safe state. This clear interaction pattern helps maintain a smooth user experience from entering a topic to receiving quiz results.

## Hosting Solutions

The backend components run locally on the user's machine alongside the Electron-based frontend, creating a self-contained environment that does not rely on external servers. This local hosting approach ensures that the app’s functionality is available even in the absence of an internet connection, except for the optional web search feature. Relying on local hosting minimizes latency issues and provides greater reliability and cost-effectiveness, as it avoids the overheads associated with cloud hosting while fully supporting the offline-first design principle.

## Infrastructure Components

The backend infrastructure includes several essential components that work together to deliver a smooth operation. At the core is the FastAPI server that manages API requests and responses. A local SQLite database handles any data storage needs, particularly for managing temporary settings or future quiz history. Additionally, the system integrates with the Ollama API to interface with the local GenAI model (mistral by default) through the Educhain module. Although system-level components such as load balancers or CDNs are not required for a local application, the architecture is modular enough to allow for future integration of caching mechanisms to further enhance performance if the app scales to include more features.

## Security Measures

Security is an essential aspect even in a locally operated system. The backend employs standard security practices such as secure coding guidelines and error handling to minimize risks related to data processing. Since the app runs offline and does not manage multiple user accounts, the exposure to typical online threats is limited, but data encryption and robust authentication protocols can be added when expanding features to include quiz history or profile functionalities in the future. The overall strategy is to ensure that local data, if stored, is secure and that any operations with external APIs—like the occasional web search—are clearly managed and transparently logged for user notification.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Monitoring the backend's performance is crucial for ensuring a reliable offline experience. The system incorporates logging mechanisms within FastAPI that capture errors and track API usage. This log data is instrumental in diagnosing issues, especially when the local generation engine faces unexpected problems. Routine maintenance of the codebase through manual and automated testing ensures that the backend remains robust and can adapt to any future enhancements. An error handling strategy that gracefully returns the user to the starting screen plays an integral role in ongoing maintenance, thus guaranteeing a smooth operation even in the event of a failure.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

In summary, the backend architecture of the Educhain Offline Quiz App is designed with simplicity, reliability, and future scalability in mind. Leveraging Python with FastAPI for creating clear and efficient APIs, and integrating a local SQLite database for storage alongside the Educhain module interfacing with the Ollama API, the system delivers a robust quiz generation engine. Local hosting enhances the responsiveness and offline-first design of the app, while strategic security measures and proactive monitoring uphold the integrity and reliability of the application. This well-rounded backend structure not only meets the current requirements but is also poised to accommodate future enhancements and integration possibilities.
